Installation works like this:

1. Clone the repo into its own folder

2. Run make

3. Put the newly-created executable where ever you want

4. Extract the contents of the "vox.zip" file into that directory

Keep in mind that this is a COMMAND LINE INTERFACE PROGRAM! You will have to use your terminal to do this.

The command-line syntax is hl-vox [filename]
You can find some example files in example-files. I'll probably make an actual tutorial on how to use this later.
